        <h3>I like to speak when it is quiet....I will not talk over people. I think everyone has the right to talk about how they feel about topics. I will pay attention to each and everyone of your concerns. I will figure out solutions to solve most of the problems that I can fix...I am running for the president of the uft....</h3>
